# quran-reader
Back in 2016, had a vision to create a editor, which help to create a arabic text with embeded "Tajweed" (good recitation) rules, using colors which is a common technique found in many quranic copies.

Using following editor, a digital tajweedi quranic text could be generated. That was the vision.

so it has issues til this date (10 december, 2020).
  1. Saving and opening the quranic text is todo work.
  2. Tajweed buttons not adding span tag in selection surronding.
  3. not mobile friendly, work in progress.
  4. UI needs to be improved with colors.
  5. good fonts needs to be linked for urdu and arabic text.
